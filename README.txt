Hi! This program runs with these versions of these things:
Python 3.5.1
Anaconda 2.5.0 
numpy 1.10.4
sklearn 0.17



Running this program uses the command line:

python proj3.py [filepath]



Output might include a deprecation warning, but then outputs which label
the program classified the image under.
